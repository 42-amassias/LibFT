# Libft

---

## Foreword

This is my solution to the project `libft` (version 16).

I also made a better version of the `libft` that I called [libft-full](https://github.com/Dyamen1411/42-libft-full) !<br>
This version is fully documented in [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) which means that you can compile the documentation with it ;)<br>
Tho be warned, it is still WIP !
This version also includes:
- More functions
- An advanced version of [ft_printf](https://github.com/Dyamen1411/42-ft_printf) (version 10)
- An version of [get_next_line](https://github.com/Dyamen1411/42-get_next_line) (version 12)

## Usage

`make` Will compile the `libft` (still with bonus hehe)

---

## Tests

I advise that you look into [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) to test this code
